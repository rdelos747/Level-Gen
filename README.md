# Level Generation Algorithms

This repo contains various level generation algorithms. They are mainly written in python as a means of quick prototyping for other software such as swift and Pico 8 applications.

Many of the algorithms use rules and techniques found in [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
